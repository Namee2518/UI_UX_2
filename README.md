## 📌 🗒 Sticky Notes — Design Insights

Below are the key sticky notes used in the UX board (FigJam):

### Home Screen
> The Home screen acts as a dashboard showing soil status, crop prediction, and live market prices. It provides quick insights like moisture level, pH value, recommended crop (Paddy), and price trends to help farmers make fast decisions.

### Soil Health Report
> This screen displays detailed soil data including moisture, pH (6.8 – optimal), and NPK levels. It helps farmers understand soil condition and take steps to improve productivity.

### Crop Recommendation
> Based on season, soil type, and water availability, the app recommends the best crop (Paddy) with expected yield and growth duration. It supports data-driven farming decisions.

### Live Market Prices
> Shows real-time prices and trends of crops in the nearby market. Farmers can track increasing, decreasing, or stable prices to decide when to sell.

### Government Schemes
> Provides information about available schemes like PM-KISAN and Soil Health Card. It shows benefits, eligibility, and status to help farmers access support.

### Expert Help
> Connects farmers with agricultural experts through chat, call, or video consultation for guidance on soil, crops, pests, and market issues.

| Crop Planning | Selects season & soil type | “Which crop should I choose?” | Fear of low yield | Data-driven recommendation | Increased yield |
| Market Intelligence | Views prices and trends | “Where/when should I sell?” | Price uncertainty | Live pricing & trends | Better profit |
| Support & Schemes | Checks government help | “Am I eligible?” | Lack of awareness | Scheme details + status | Access benefits |
| Expert Help | Contacts expert | “Need guidance” | Limited expert access | Chat/Call/Video | Confidence in decisions |
